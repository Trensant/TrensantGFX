# TrensantGFX  (a chart library built on opensource projects)

TrensantGX (Trensant Graphics) is a client-side javascript library for rendering charts.  It wraps components of different charting libraries with a common api and handles loading.  TrensantGFX is designed to run standalone and to run offline with minimal dependancies.  This means it can use to quick-test ideas, and also can take files outputted from non web friendly environments such as embedded systems.

The charting library uses charts from several well known libraries, but normalizes their input as noted in the Chart Data section. Not all libraries are fully wrapped, meaning that the tgw libary provides wrappers only for the charts listed here, even if other charts exist in those libaries.   In some cases we wrap the same chart type from different sources.

To use a chart from a particular source family note the prefix (e.g. ggl or d3 etc)

## Offline Notes

Where possible examples are given in minimal form with live edit capability.  *Available offline*: denotes that the example can run without a server (e.g. Apache or nodejs not required) by just navigating to the files.  (open as file:// in a browser).


## Examples
======================================

*Available offline*
### Work Flow #1 - See Chart Samples

1. Open browser
2. Open the ./all-charts.html file (ctrl o). Or if I have a dev server running on your local navigate to all-charts.html.

=====================================

*Available offline*
### Workflow #2 - View charts with your own sample data.

Browser Dependent: 
Chrome start with step one
1. Start a local server such as python -m http.server
Firefox Start with step 2
2. Open examples/gallery.html
3. Select the chart.
4. This opens a live edit page. 
5. Paste in your data.
The structure of your data must match the sample data structure shown in the live edit window.
For example in d3BubbleChart.html there is sample data labeled bubbleSampledata. Your data's structure must match in order for the chart to render correctly.
6. (optional) Add additional parameters to alter the rendering of the data. See API Documentation.
7. Click Run Code.

===================================================
### Workflow #3 - Add a chart to my web page.

1. Open the dist folder.
2. Choose and save which twg you want.
    1. twg.js or twg.min.js is just the Twig functions. You will need to add library dependencies to your page for these Twig methods. Please see Additional Notes on Other Libraries for specifics on other libraries.
    2. twgWithDependencies.js or twgWithDependencies.min.js includes available libraries which currently is only d3. Please see Additional Notes on Other Libraries for specifics on other libraries. 
3. Add in your html page.

## Usage
Being a client side rendering library trensantGFX only runs in a browser environment.  See the examples to sample charts and data sets.

<script>
	...

	...
	//code to get pie data
	...
	trensantGFX.gglDrawPie(piedata,"myPieChartDiv", {... options go here are .... });
	

</script>

```



## Data and Packing

Charts take data either as a table (matrix) or as a structured tree.   See specific charts for required data types.  For charts which take a tree type structure the library provides some data packing functions which can be used to take a flat structure and convert it to the tree structure.

trensantGFX|lib|chartName (data, domID options);

for example:
trensantGFX.drawRowWordCloud(data,"myDiv",)


### Libaries Wrapped:
* Google charts
* D3.js (version 4) not compatible with V3
* jqwordcloud (relies on JQuery)
* trensantGFX (natively drawn chart)

All calls are prefixed with a prefix identifying the library name:

| Base Library | Prefix | Example                        |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| google       | ggl    | tgw.gglDrawPieChart()  		 |
| D3           | d3     | tgw.d3DrawTreeMap()    		 |
| trensant     | tg     | tgw.tgPrettyPrint()     		 |
| jqcloud      | jwc    | tgw.jqWordCloud()      		 |
| plotly       | pty    | tgw.ptyPieChart()		 		 |

The following charts are included trensantGFX:


| chart type 			| input-form  | source-libraries | notes                                |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| prettyPrint           | json        | tgw      | prints any object as pretty printed  |
| rowWordCloud          | dict        | tgw      | creates a row-word cloud             |
| bar		 			| matrix	  | 				 |   |

## loading libs and asynchronicity
The graphics charts libararies must be loaded before any calls can be made.  For some libaries, such as google charts callbacks are used to determine of the entire chart libaries are loaded before any rendering or data packing calls are allowed.  


## TODO
TrensantGFX handles insuring that all chart-libs are loaded before rendering calls are made and if they are not loaded will cache the data (in a closure) until the chart lib is avaliable.  
This frees the developer from maintaining library load states accross the various libaries.

Twig was created for easy chart exploration and creation. 

It is focused on providing the easiest work flows so that you can see and update charts quickly and easily.

### Additional notes on Other Libraries

#### Plotly

	<script type="text/javascript" src="./libs/plotly.min.js"></script>
Currently plotly.js cannot be loaded using NPM 5.0.0. 
See https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/1745 for current status.


Instead you must either. 


Use dist/twg.js and add a plotly.js reference to your html page. 

	<script type="text/javascript" src="./libs/plotly.min.js"></script>

or

Use webpack to include plotly.js in your own build using another NPM version.


#### C3
C3 cannot be used in conjuction with d3 due to library conflicts. If you wish to use c3 functions from Twig you have two options. 

Use dist/twg.js and add a c3 reference to your html page. Such as:

    <script src="./libs/c3.min.js"> </script> 

Use webpack to include c3 in your own build.
	
#### GoogleCharts
GoogleCharts cannot be used offline. To use Twig functions that call GoogleCharts you must include the following references in your html page.

	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
	


=========================================	
### Build Notes
#### Webpack
We use webpack to build our dist files and include the built files. To build your own dev file enter at the console:
$> webpack

with dependencies:
webpack --config webpack-dependencies.config.js  

To build a minified production version:
	Add an environment variable PROD_ENV and set to 1.
    rerun
	
Twig API
The best source of method documentation is in src/js/tgw.js.
